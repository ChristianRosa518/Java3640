1. we cannot change the length of an array once created in java but can in arraylist.
2. an abstract class is a super class
you can't use this class to create a class
however you can use this class as an extension for another
class. this makes the extended class require the methods of the extendor.
3. Polymorphism is  the use of super classes such as an abstract class of animal or
an interface of Pet.
dog extends animal, dog interfaces pet. It's used for reusability.
4. to acheive abstraction, forces classes to use the methods in the interface.
